# PLAN.md Phase 13: "strict CSP on Nostr login page." Matches the policy
# YunoHost's own nginx config applies to /yunohost/sso/ (see
# PHASE0_INVESTIGATION.md) - same shape, since this page has the same
# threat model (a login surface).
#
# connect-src adds 'wss:' (beyond the 'self' every other directive falls
# back to) for Phase 10's NIP-46 support: the client has to open a
# WebSocket to whatever relay a bunker:// link names, or to this page's
# own default relay list for the nostrconnect:// QR flow - both are
# inherently third-party origins we can't pin down to a fixed allowlist.
#
# script-src is 'self' only, no 'unsafe-inline' - PLAN.md Phase 13's
# "strict CSP" is only as strict as this directive, since it's the one
# that actually blocks arbitrary injected <script>/onclick=.../javascript:
# execution. Both pages' logic lives in the external nostr-*-page.js files
# under web/static/ specifically so this can be 'self'-only; keep it that
# way rather than adding an inline <script> back. style-src keeps
# 'unsafe-inline' - both pages still use inline <style> blocks and style="
# ..." attributes, and CSS injection isn't in the same severity class as
# script injection for this threat model.
