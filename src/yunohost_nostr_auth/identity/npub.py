"""npub <-> canonical hex pubkey conversion, for the UI boundary only.

PLAN.md Phase 4: "Do not use npub internally... store the canonical hex
public key." Everything past this module (mappings, linking, verification)
deals exclusively in hex; npub only exists where a human types or reads one.

Delegates to nostr-sdk's own bech32 handling rather than a second
hand-rolled implementation alongside auth/nostr_verify.py's use of it.
